# Python for Cybersecurity Learning Course

A comprehensive, self-guided Python learning project designed specifically for cybersecurity beginners. Learn Python fundamentals through practical cybersecurity applications with hands-on exercises and automated testing.

## Course Overview

This course teaches Python programming through real-world cybersecurity scenarios. Each module is designed for progressive learning and includes:
- **Concept Introduction**: Core Python concepts explained with practical cybersecurity examples.
- **Warm-up Exercises**: Skill-building exercises with immediate feedback via automated tests.
- **Main Challenge**: A comprehensive problem applying the module's concepts to a cybersecurity task. 
- **Automated Testing**: Built-in validation to guide your learning and confirm your solutions.

## Learning Pathway and Module Structure

This course is structured to build foundational knowledge step-by-step. Core concepts like variables, operators, and conditionals are covered first. We then introduce data structures before diving deep into iteration techniques.

**Rationale for Module Order:**
Understanding how to organize and store collections of data is crucial before learning how to efficiently process them. Therefore:
- **Lists (Module 4)** and **Dictionaries (Module 5)** are introduced first to solidify your understanding of these fundamental data structures.
- **Loops (Module 6)** are taught subsequently, as they are powerful tools for iterating over and working with the data structures you've just learned.
This pedagogical approach aims to build a strong foundation in data handling before automating tasks with loops. Subsequent modules then build upon these combined skills for more advanced topics.

### Module 1: Variables & Data Types
Learn to store and manage cybersecurity data like IP addresses, user credentials, and system status.

### Module 2: Operators
Master comparison and logical operations for security threshold monitoring and decision making.

### Module 3: Conditional Statements
Build intelligent security systems that make automated decisions based on threat levels and conditions.

### Module 4: Lists
(Formerly Module 5)
Manage collections of security data including user accounts, IP addresses, and vulnerability lists.

### Module 5: Dictionaries
(Formerly Module 6)
Organize complex security information like user profiles, system configurations, and security policies.

### Module 6: Loops
(Formerly Module 4)
Automate repetitive security tasks like network scanning, log analysis, and system monitoring, now leveraging your knowledge of lists and dictionaries.

### Module 7: Functions
Create reusable security tools and automated analysis functions for password strength and threat assessment.

### Module 8: File I/O
Process security logs, configuration files, and automated reporting for cybersecurity operations.

### Module 9: Error Handling
Build robust security systems with proper error handling and custom security exceptions.

## How to Use This Course

1. **Start with Module 1** - Run `python 01_variables.py` (or the current module file, e.g., `python 04_lists.py`) to begin working on a module.
2. **Complete Warm-up Exercises** - Follow the TODO comments in each exercise
3. **Tackle the Main Challenge** - Apply your skills to comprehensive cybersecurity problems
4. **Check Your Progress** - Built-in tests provide immediate feedback
5. **Advance to Next Module** - Each module builds on previous concepts

## Getting Started

```bash
# Run any module to start learning
python 01_variables.py

# Or use the configured workflow
# The system will guide you through exercises and testing
```

## Learning Approach
