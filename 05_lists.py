MODULE 5: LISTS - Managing Collections of Security Data 📋
====================================================================

Welcome to Module 5! You've been using lists in previous modules, but now
you'll master them completely. Lists are essential for cybersecurity work
because you're always dealing with collections: IP addresses, user accounts,
security alerts, port numbers, and more.

WHAT ARE LISTS?
Lists are ordered collections that can store multiple items. Think of them
as containers that hold related data together, like a list of authorized
users or a collection of suspicious IP addresses.

LIST OPERATIONS WE'LL COVER:
- Creating and accessing lists
- Adding and removing items
- Searching and sorting lists
- List slicing and manipulation
- Common list methods for security work

PRACTICE: Initial Device Inventory

Your organization is setting up its network. The first three core devices acquired are

# YOUR MAIN EXERCISE: Build a Security Asset Management System
# ============================================================================
"""
CHALLENGE: SECURITY ASSET MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

You're building a system to manage various security assets within your organization.
This involves tracking network devices, user accounts, security alerts, and
vulnerability data. Each task below builds upon lists to manage this information.

TASK 1: NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TRACKING
   Your initial list of core network devices is: "firewall", "router", "switch", "server".
   Two updates are needed:
   1. An "intrusion_detection_system" has been added. Append it to your list.
   2. A "load_balancer" was installed earlier and should be inserted into the list
      right after the "router" (i.e., it will become the third item if "router" is second).
   (Start with `network_devices`. After these operations, make the final list available
   as `final_network_devices`, and store the total count of devices in `final_device_count`.)

TASK 2: USER ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
   The current list of user account types is: "admin", "user1", "user2", "guest".
   Perform these changes:
   1. The "guest" account type is being removed.
   2. Two new account types, "analyst" and "manager", are being added to the list.
   After these changes, also verify if the "admin" account type is still present.
   (Start with `user_accounts`. The final list of account types should be stored in
   `final_user_accounts`. A boolean indicating if "admin" is in this final list
   should be stored in `is_admin_in_final_list`.)

TASK 3: SECURITY ALERT TRACKING
   You have received four security alerts as plain text messages:
     Alert 1: "Failed login attempt from IP address 203.0.113.42"
     Alert 2: "High CPU usage detected on server-01"
     Alert 3: "Suspicious file detected in downloads folder"
     Alert 4: "Firewall rule violation from internal network"
   Your tasks are:
   1. Collect these four alerts into a list called `security_alerts_log`.
   2. Create a new list, `formatted_initial_alerts`, where each alert message from
      `security_alerts_log` is prefixed by its 1-based index number (e.g., "1: Alert message...").
   3. The first alert in `security_alerts_log` has been resolved. Remove it from the list.
      Store the content of this removed alert in `removed_alert_content`.
   4. Create another list, `formatted_remaining_alerts`, from the updated `security_alerts_log`
      (after removal), again prefixing each alert with its new 1-based index.

TASK 4: VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
   You have a list of raw vulnerability scores from a recent scan: `[8.5, 6.2, 9.1, 4.3, 7.8]`.
   Process these scores:
   1. Sort these scores in descending order (highest to lowest). Store this sorted list
      in `sorted_vulnerability_scores`. The original list can be modified or you can create a new one.
   2. From the `sorted_vulnerability_scores`, create a new list called `high_severity_vulns_list`
      that includes only scores greater than 7.0.
   3. Calculate the average of the original `vulnerability_scores`. If the list of scores
      were empty, the average should be considered 0.0. Store this average in `average_vuln_score`.
   (Define the initial `vulnerability_scores` list yourself as part of your solution for this task.)

TASK 5: SECURITY DASHBOARD SUMMARY DATA
   To populate a security dashboard, you need to consolidate some key metrics from the
   previous tasks. Create the following global variables and assign them values based on
   the final state of your data from Tasks 1-4:
   - `dashboard_total_devices`: The total number of network devices (from `final_device_count`).
   - `dashboard_total_users`: The total number of user account types (from `final_user_accounts`).
   - `dashboard_active_alerts_count`: The number of alerts remaining in `security_alerts_log`.
   - `dashboard_highest_vulnerability`: The highest score from `sorted_vulnerability_scores`
     (if the list is empty, this should be 0.0).

Ensure all results are stored in the specified global variables for checking.
